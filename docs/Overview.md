# Tutorial Overview

This tutorial's main goal is to help teach, guide, and allow a practice space for learning how to utilize 
polymorphism, abstraction, reflection, and generics (in no particular order!)

When I try to teach new developers these concepts, I often find myself rambling, awkwardly going back and forth,
trying to express why they're important and how they're implemented. It'll go over many of their heads as the ramblings
of a crazy person, but for some it might click here and there. However, it never _really_ seems to land and that's not
their fault. Because, in my opinion, it's the practice that really lets those ideas sink in.

However, sometimes the opportunities can be few in a professional setting where the foundation has already been layed 
for you. 

That's where this project comes in. The idea is you'll be given a starting point and then asked to refactor and expand
using the principles above. Additionally, the project is set up to mimic business processes you might find in an
enterprise microservice chain.

This isn't _too_ much different than following a guide online, however, where I think this
tutorial really differs (and shines, if I do say so myself), is that in addition to getting a space to practice - you'll 
also be given two additional modules to be used as examples - one good, and one bad.

What I mean by this is that there will be a module labeled: 'good'. This module represents what your final practice
implementation should look like (or close to). You can go to this module when your stuck to draw inspiration  
(or copy, I won't tell) so that you can get passed any obstacles that you may be struggling with.

The 'bad' module was something I created to show some no-no's in the coding world that I've either done myself before 
(and regretted) or have encountered by other developers. I think this is an important
